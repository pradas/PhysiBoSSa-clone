 * \class CellCycleNetwork
 * \brief Cell Cycle directed by boolean network
 *
 *	Cell cycle and cell properties are controlled by the boolean network linked to the cell, calling MaBoSS instance.
 *	Takes as input current state of the cell (surrounding, acces to O2, contact with other cells, with ECM...) and read outputs from the netowrk (Migration, Proliferation...), and update cell state accordingly (cycle phase, migrative parameter...).
 *
 * Possible inputs and outputs depends on the structures of the network, try to put different possibilities.
